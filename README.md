# binary-search-tree
- buildTree(array) function that takes an array of data (e.g., [1, 7, 4, 23, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 67, 6345, 324]) and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed.
- insert(value) and deleteItem(value) functions that insert/delete the given value.
- find(value) function that returns the node with the given value.
- levelOrder(callback) function that accepts a callback function as its parameter.
- inOrder(callback), preOrder(callback), and postOrder(callback) functions that also accept a callback as a parameter.
- height(node) function that returns the given node’s height. Height is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from a given node to a leaf node.
- depth(node) function that returns the given node’s depth. Depth is defined as the number of edges in the path from a given node to the tree’s root node.
- isBalanced function that checks if the tree is balanced.
- rebalance function that rebalances an unbalanced tree.
